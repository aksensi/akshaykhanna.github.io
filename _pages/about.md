I am a Graduate Student at [North Carolina State University](https://ece.ncsu.edu/grad/) pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering specilizing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. My Bachelors was in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from University of Mumbai, India. This transition from Mumbai to Raleigh has been an exciting chapter, allowing me to delve deeper into my passion for technology while honing my skills in a cutting-edge field.  

Throughout my academic journey, hands-on experience gained from internships and research has been pivotal in shaping my career trajectory towards artificial intelligence (AI). This practical exposure has not only motivated me but also equipped me with the necessary skills and insights for a career in this dynamic field. My expertise and interests primarily revolve around the following areas:

ðŸ‘‰ Machine Learning
ðŸ‘‰ Data Science and Analytics
ðŸ‘‰ Computer Vision/ Image Processing
ðŸ‘‰ Machine Vision and Perception
ðŸ‘‰ Generative AI
